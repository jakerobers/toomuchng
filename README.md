# Too Much Angular!

<img align="right" src="logo.png">

After writing yet another angular application, I figured it would be best to create a scaffolder fine-tuned to my needs.

What's in the box?
 - Service for auth
 - Service for sessions
 - Starter page
 - Starter Sass files
 - Html templating

## Installation
```
npm install -g generator-toomuchng
```

## Usage

First, create a project directory and cd into it. After that, run any/all of the below items:

### Basic Scaffolding
```
yo toomuchng
```

_Note: the following subcommands are for generating different components, it is recommended to use a capital letter as the first character._

### Collection
```
yo toomuchng:collection
```

### Component
Creating a new component will also generate html and sass files for you.
```
yo toomuchng:component
```

### Directive
```
yo toomuchng:directive
```

### Filter
```
yo toomuchng:filter
```

### Model
```
yo toomuchng:model
```

### Page
Creating a new page will also generate html and sass files for you.
```
yo toomuchng:page
```

### Service
```
yo toomuchng:service
```


## Contribution
